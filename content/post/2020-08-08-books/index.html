<hr />
<p>:books:<em>currently reading</em>: <a href="https://books2read.com/u/brWQZE">Anna Karenina - Leo Tolstoy</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The following list contains my favorite books - both fiction and non-fiction - in no particular order. Of course, this post will probably evolve over time and I will do a regular update.</p>
<div id="harry-potter---j.k.-rowling" class="section level1">
<h1>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CJG28U8">Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling</a></h1>
<p><img src="harrypotter.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am sorry for starting a list of top 10 books with a series, but I couldn’t help it. To anyone that knows me this should not come as a surprise anyways, since I am a huge Potterhead. :smile:</p>

<div id="a-little-life---hanya-yanagihara" class="section level1">
<h1>2. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/bOxW1g">A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="alittlelife.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>It may be dark and traumatic, but Hanya Yanagihara’s second novel offers a refreshingly modern take on friendship in the age of anxiety. You find more compelling reasons for reading this book in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/20/a-little-life-why-everyone-should-read-this-modern-day-classic">article</a>.</p>

<div id="thinking-fast-and-slow---daniel-kahneman" class="section level1">
<h1>3. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/4jWZKD">Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman</a></h1>
<p><img src="kahneman.png" /></p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman - world-famous psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics - takes you on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think.</p>

<div id="sapiens---yuval-noah-harari" class="section level1">
<h1>4. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/4AKGgK">Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="sapiens.png" width="250" />
</center>
<p>The most important book about the history of humankind. I also suggest that you look up the <a href="https://www.ynharari.com">author</a> and consider reading the follow-up books - they are brilliant too.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="george-orwell" class="section level1">
<h1>5. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/4XnWge">1984 - George Orwell</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="1984.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>It’s almost impossible to talk about propaganda, surveillance, authoritarian politics, or perversions of truth without dropping a reference to 1984. Unfortunately, all of these topics are still as relevant today, as they were back in 1949, when this dystopian novel was published. Big Brother is watching you…</p>

<div id="brave-new-world---aldous-huxley" class="section level1">
<h1>6. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/barRPL">Brave New World - Aldous Huxley</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="huxley.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>This profoundly important classic of world literature, is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls.</p>

<div id="flow---mihaly-csikszentmihalyi" class="section level1">
<h1>7. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/bwd08y">Flow - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="flow.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>The idea behind this books is to explain how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of our lives. By following its guidelines, this book makes me happy every day. :blush:</p>

<div id="a-gentleman-in-moscow---amor-towles" class="section level1">
<h1>8. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/meel0l">A Gentleman in Moscow - Amor Towles</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="moscow.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>A novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel. Perhaps the ultimate quarantine read. Also I am <del>mildly</del> obsessed with Mother Russia :ru:.</p>
<hr />

<div id="evil-plans---hugh-macleod" class="section level1">
<h1>9. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/b6ZgQp">Evil PLans - Hugh MacLeod</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="evil.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>If you want to have fun on your road to world domination. :smiling_imp:</p>

<div id="how-to-predict-the-unpredictable---william-poundstone" class="section level1">
<h1>10. <a href="https://books2read.com/u/mKzW9B">How to Predict the Unpredictable - William Poundstone</a></h1>
<center>
<img src="smart.jpg" width="250" />
</center>
<p>We are hard-wired to believe that the world is more predictable than it is. We chase ‘winning streaks’ that are often just illusions, and we are all too predictable exactly when we try hardest not to be. This one goes out to all the gamblers :black_joker::game_die:.</p>
