<blockquote>
<p>Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dataset I will be analyzing comes from the <code>friends</code> R package for the Friends transcripts and additional information. The friends package can be installed from CRAN with <code>install.packages("friends")</code>. h/t to <a href="https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt">Emil Hvitfeldt</a> for aggregating, packaging and sharing this data with us! I learned about the existence of this awesome dataset thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday</a> project.</p>
<div id="tidytuesday" class="section level3">
<h3>TidyTuesday</h3>
<p>Join the R4DS Online Learning Community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event!
Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data.
While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format.
The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community!
As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Let’s start with the basic setup for my analysis. Here I just load the <code>tidytuesdayR</code> package for downloading the data as efficiently as possible.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># setup the file and load the necessary packages

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidytuesdayR)

# load the data from the TidyTuesdayR package
friends &lt;- tt_load(&#39;2020-09-08&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Downloading file 1 of 3: `friends.csv`
##  Downloading file 2 of 3: `friends_info.csv`
##  Downloading file 3 of 3: `friends_emotions.csv`</code></pre>

<h1>Quality over time</h1>
<p>I briefly mentioned already that the series is an all-time favorite of mine, but that is, of course, just my personal taste. Also, it can be very difficult to keep up the quality of a series for 10 seasons. Thus, let’s have look at the information we got to answer the question: how did viewership and IMDb ratings evolve over time?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Graph ratings over time
 
ratings &lt;- friends$friends_info %&gt;%
  select(-directed_by, -written_by, -us_views_millions) %&gt;%
  mutate(episode_title = glue(&quot;{ season }.{ episode } { title }&quot;), episode_title = fct_reorder(episode_title, season + .001 * episode)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(as.integer(episode_title), imdb_rating)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(season), 
                 text = paste(title,
                              &#39;&lt;br&gt;IMDb rating:&#39;, imdb_rating))) +
  labs(title = &quot;IMDb Ratings Over Time&quot;,
       x = &quot;Episode number&quot;, 
       y = &quot;IMDb Rating&quot;,
       color = &quot;Season&quot;)

<p>Looking at the plot above, we can see that the general quality of the series did not decline over time. The ratings are exceptionally high across all episodes, with the lowest rated episode being “The One with the Invitation” (7.2).

<p>Even though it is possible to identify a negative trend in viewership from season 2 to season 7 - with “The One with the Vows” as the low point - the series excited more than 15 million US viewers in every episode. The spikes in the total views for “The One After the Superbowl” and “The Last One” are due to the fact that these episodes aired as double features. In sum, I think it is fair to say that the series was a great success!</p>

<p>Using my processed dataset, I created a unique visualization using the <code>gt</code> package.</p>

<p>Thus, in a first step I had to create a theme for my table to present the data in style.</p>

<p>It seems like the authors of the series kept close track of the appearances of each main character. There is not much variation in the fraction of total utterances.</p>

<h1>Emotional Friends</h1>
<p>As the final part of this article I will make use of the <code>ggradar</code>package and visualize the emotional profiles of our six friends.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggradar)

emotion_radar &lt;- friends_emotions_info %&gt;%
  select(emotion, speaker) %&gt;%
  filter(speaker %in% main_characters) %&gt;%
  filter(emotion != &quot;Neutral&quot;) %&gt;%
  add_count(speaker, name = &quot;total_utterances&quot;) %&gt;%
  add_count(speaker, emotion) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = emotion, values_from = n, values_fn = mean) %&gt;%
  mutate(across(3:8, ~. / total_utterances)) %&gt;%
  select(-total_utterances) %&gt;%
  ggradar(values.radar = c(&quot;0%&quot;, &quot;20%&quot;, &quot;40%&quot;), grid.mid = 0.2, grid.max = 0.4, grid.label.size = 4, axis.label.size = 2, group.line.width = 1, group.point.size = 2, plot.legend = FALSE, plot.title = &quot;Emotional Profiles of the Six Friends&quot;) + facet_wrap(~group)

Overall, the dominant emotion seems to be joy, which does not come as a surprise to anyone who has watched a single episode of the series. And if you need further visualization of Ross being scared, I will just leave this final GIF here :wink:</p>

<p>There is a ton of possibilities for future articles on this subject and I might give it another shot to familiarize myself with new R packages.</p>
